    <h2 id="what-make-hero">What makes a superhero?</h2>

    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>,
        and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a
        superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or
        human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero
        story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he
        becomes a superhero.<br><br><i>Article on superheroes at</i>

    <p>Spider-Man</p>

    <p>After being bitten by a radioactive spider, high school student Peter Parker gained incredible abilities,
        including
        enhanced strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls. Learning that “with great power comes great
        responsibility,” he dedicated his life to fighting crime in New York City as the masked hero, Spider-Man.
        Balancing his
        double life as a superhero and an ordinary teenager, he protects the city from dangerous villains while carrying
        the
        weight of his personal struggles.
